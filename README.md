# WearableSensing
The goal of this repo is building a smartwatch app and a companion app to monitor and analyze stroke patient exercise.
We plan to create a set of unique features to stimulate patient motivation to exercise and know their projected recovery timeline and current progress. 
Exercise quality is of critical importance in understanding and evolving the recovery process, 
and we hope to connect patients to their physical trainers on a daily basis, only digitally. 
Stroke patients need to feel encouraged and have a clear sense of their body movements during the long-term recovery phase. 
Signal processing and/or machine learning are the main elements used to create features and analyze patient data.
This project is advised by Professor Reinkensmeyer at the University of California, Irvine. This is a test.
